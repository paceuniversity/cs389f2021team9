**Sprint 2**
Sprint Planed:

US1	Map View	      F	    As a user I should be able to visit all maps as on app so that I can have a big picture regarding the campus in my mind.

US2	Index View	    F		  As a user I should be able to find rooms by index "a ~z" so that when I can easily find the place when I already know the name of the place.

US8	Secret	F		As a developer, I should be able to block but mark the restrict area or private area to users so that users will not go to the wrong place accidently

US9	Database	NF		As a developer, I should be able to creat a datebase as a cerntain structure as "RoomName - Picture - LocationDetail" so that I can make the activities link with the database to show the contents other than make too many pages.

US10	Main Gates Pics	NF	As a user, I should be able to see the gate pic of the location from app so that user can make sure they arrive at the right place.

US11 Search Function	F 	As a user, I should be able to use search function so that I can easily find the place.

US12 Schools View		  F   As a user I should be able to find rooms by "school" so that when I can easily find the high frequence place regarding my school or major.

US14	Set Button On Maps	NF	As a user, I should be able to click the maps so that I can easily inquire the information on screen.

Other - Creat a new Icon
      - Be sure avoid the copyright issue
